# Udacity's Feed Reader Testing Project

The aim of this project is to test Udacity's blog feed via Javascript and [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) in order to instill the
best practices of test-driven development.

## Running The App

Clone the app via:

`$ git clone https://github.com/asherem/udacity-feed-testing-jasmine.git`

Click on the folder and open `index.html` to view the page. Since the menu is visible by default, the testing suite
can be accessed at the bottom of the page.

## What's Inside

Besides this `README.md`, you will find a `jasmine` folder with the Jasmine library as well as the set of tests,
`feedreader.js`, and `app.js`, which sets feed behavior via Ajax. Also, `style.css` is critical for its menu-hiding
properties, which are used by the testing suite.

## Acknowledgements

Thank you to the Udacity Discussion forums for ideas and suggestions.
